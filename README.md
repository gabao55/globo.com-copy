<h2>Context</h2>

<p>First project developed for Driven Software Engineer bootcamp, you can check it out by this <a href="https://hf75e2.csb.app/">link</a>. The first module of the course was an introduction to Interfaces and Front-end Aplications, so we explored the main functionalities of HTML and CSS, so to consolidate knowledge the project task was to create a copy of the <a href="https://www.globo.com/" globo.com</a> webpage interface. The webpage might have suferred some updates, so you can check the project prototype below for desktop and mobile interfaces:
